This project is a simple API for ordering food, with functionality for customers, restaurants, and orders.

The API allows customers to browse restaurants, place orders, and view their order history. Restaurants can manage their menu, view orders, and users can leave reviews and order meals.

The API is built using NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework, and is intended for educational purposes, allowing developers to practice building a basic API with user authentication and data persistence.
